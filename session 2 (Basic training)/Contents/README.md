###### 1. Variables and Data Types
###### 2. Taking Input from the User
###### 3. Conditionals (if, elif, else)
###### 4. Loops
###### 5. Functions


### 1. Variables and Data Types
##### Python allows you to store data in variables.

```python
name = "Alice"      # Assign a string value "Alice" to the variable `name`.
age = 25            # Assign an integer value 25 to the variable `age`.
height = 5.5        # Assign a float value 5.5 (decimal number) to the variable `height`.
is_student = True   # Assign a boolean value `True` to the variable `is_student`.

print("Name:", name)# Print the value of `name` with a label "Name:".
print("Age:", age)  # Print the value of `age` with a label "Age:".
print("Height:", height)# Print the value of `height` with a label "Height:".
print("Is a student:", is_student)# Print the value of `is_student` with a label "Is a student:".
```


### 2. Taking Input from the User
##### Use the input() function to get user input.
```python
# Prompt the user to enter their name and store the input as a string in the variable `user_name`.
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")  # The `input` function always returns a string.

# Print a greeting message that includes the user's name. 
# Use a combination of string concatenation and comma-separated values for formatting.
print("Hello ", user_name + "!")  # `user_name + "!"` appends "!" to the user's name.
```


### 3. Conditionals (if, elif, else)
##### Control the flow of the program using conditions.

```python
# Categorizing a person based on their age using if-elif-else statements

if age < 18:                            # Check if the age falls into the "minor" category
    print("You are a minor.")           # This executes if the age is less than 18
elif age >= 18 and age < 60:            # Using `and` to combine two conditions: age >= 18 and age < 60
    print("You are an adult.")          # This executes if age is between 18 and 59 (inclusive)
else:                                   # If the age does not match the above conditions, it falls into the "senior citizen" category
    print("You are a senior citizen.")  # This executes for ages 60 and above
```
### 4. Loops
##### Use loops to repeat a block of code.
##### a. For loop

```python
# Print a heading to indicate the counting starts.
print("\nCounting from 1 to 5:")

# Start a for loop that iterates through numbers generated by range(1, 6, 1).
for i in range(1, 6, 1):  # range(start, stop, step): starts at 1, stops before 6, increments by 1.
    print(i)  # Print the current number in each iteration.
```


##### b. While loop

```python
# Print a heading to indicate the countdown starts.
print("\nCountdown from 5:")

# Initialize the countdown variable with the starting value 5.
count = 5

# Start a while loop that runs as long as count is greater than 0.
while count > 0:  
    print(count)  # Print the current value of count.
    count -= 1  # Decrease the value of count by 1 in each iteration.
```


### 5. Functions
##### Functions allow us to reuse blocks of code.

```python
# Define a function to greet the user by name and display a welcome message.
def greet(name):  
    """This function greets the user."""  # Docstring explaining what the function does.
    print(f"Welcome {name}")  # Print a formatted welcome message with the user's name.

# Call the function with the user's name ("ali") as an argument.
greet("ali")

# Define a function to perform operations on two numbers and return results.
def factor32(num, ali_age):  
    return num + 1, ali_age + 6  # Increment num by 1 and ali_age by 6, and return both values.

# Call factor32 with arguments 18 and 22, and unpack the results into variables a and _.
a, _ = factor32(18, 22)  # The second value is ignored by assigning it to _.
print(a)  # Print the value of a (result of num + 1).

# Call factor32 with arguments 17 and 21, and unpack the results into variables a and b.
a, b = factor32(17, 21)  
print(a, b)  # Print both a (num + 1) and b (ali_age + 6).
```
